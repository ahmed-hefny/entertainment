    adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits
    these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual
    cortex and other areas of the brain. Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and
