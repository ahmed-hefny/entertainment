    Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their
    different muscles to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the
    pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the main muscle of
